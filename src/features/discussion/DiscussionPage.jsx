            The dominant color is red‚Äîglobally associated with intensity, danger
            and passion. In color psychology, it stimulates faster
            decision-making, increases heart rate, and is linked with bold
            (spicy, even) experiences. The aggressive red background of the
            packaging signals the consumer to prepare for a hot and thrilling
            sensory experience!

            product and elevating it as the main focal point of the radial
            balance exhibited in the packaging. Emanating from the plate, the
            radiating noodles and garnish imply explosion and movement, visually
            mirroring the burst of heat one expects from spicy food. The
            composition creates a dynamic energy, drawing the eye in.
